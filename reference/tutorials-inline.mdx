Displaying images and videos inline is the most popular use case for Embedly. With Embedly jQuery, you can add rich media to any site with just a few lines of code.

## Example 1: Replace

It's tricky to show an inline example because it fit seamlessly into a normal web page. For the first example we will show an inline image.

The above example uses [Embedly jQuery](https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery)
 to just replace all the `a` tags with the embedded media. The html looks like:

```html
<p>
  <a href="http://instagram.com/p/TwWnNSIXRo/">http://instagram.com/p/TwWnNSIXRo/</a>
</p>

```

And with just a little bit of JS we can replace the `a` tag with the image.

```javascript
$('p a').embedly({
    key: 'Your Embedly Key',
    query: {maxwidth:530} });

```

## Example 2: Click to Replace

To slow it down a bit and show you what actually happened, here is the same HTML.

Click on the button to see the image be replaced inline.

The JavaScript looks like this

```javascript
$('.button').on('click', function(){
   $('p a').embedly({query: {maxwidth:530} });
});

```
