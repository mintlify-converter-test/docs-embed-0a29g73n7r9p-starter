url

string

The URL is to retrieve embedding information. This URL must be escaped to ensure that Embedly retrieves the correct link. For example, this Embedly URL.

urls

string

A comma separated list of urls for Embedly to process. Each URL must be escaped, but commas separating URLS must NOT be URL encoded. urls accepts a maximum of 10 urls at a time. Embedly processes these urls in parallel, therefore, itâ€™s quicker to use urls for batched processing.

maxwidth

int32

This is the maximum width of the embed in pixels. maxwidth is used for scaling down embeds so they fit into a certain width. If the container for an embed is 500px you should pass maxwidth=500 in the query parameters.

maxheight

int32

This is the maximum height of the embed in pixels. Functions the same as maxwidth, but for the height of the embed instead. Itâ€™s noteworthy that maxwidth is preferred over maxheight.

width

int32

Will scale embeds type rich and video to the exact width that a developer specifies in pixels. Embeds smaller than this width will be scaled up and embeds larger than this width will be scaled down. Note that using this may cause distortion when scaling up embeds.

height

int32

Will scale embeds type rich and video to the exact height that a developer specifies in pixels. Embeds smaller than this height will be scaled up and embeds larger than this height will be scaled down. Note that using this may cause distortion when scaling up embeds.

format

string

The response format â€“ Accepted values: (xml, json)

wmode

string

Will append the wmode value to the flash object. Possible values include window, opaque and transparent.

callback

string

Returns a (jsonp) response format. The callback is the name of the javascript function to execute.

allowscripts

boolean

By default Embedly does not return script embeds for jsonp requests. They just donâ€™t work and cause lots of issues. In some cases, you may need the script tag for saving and displaying later. In order for Embedly to send the script embeds over jsonp add allowscripts=true. Use with care, and this option is only valid when a callback is supplied, otherwise, it is ignored.

truefalse

autoplay

boolean

This will tell the video/rich media to automatically play when the media is loaded. Accepted values: (true, false) Default: false

truefalse

words

string

The words parameter works by trying to split the description at the closest sentence to that word count

chars

string

chars is much simpler than words. Embedly will blindly truncate a description to the number of characters you specify adding ... at the end when needed.

luxe

boolean

With luxe Embedlyâ€™s iframe is initially loaded with poster image and play button rather than loading the whole embed. When the user clicks play the embed is loaded and starts playing.

truefalse

secure

boolean

secure allows you to serve embeds with a SSL connection. You can also serve images over SSL with our Display product. You can enable this by adding secure=true.

truefalse

scheme

string

scheme allows to set the protocol scheme explicity to http or https. By default embeds are sent back protocol-less so that they will work in any page. You can explicity set a protocol by adding scheme=https.

title

string

With title Embedly will set the title response attribute to the open\_graph, meta, or twitter title if available in the page. Accepted values: (og, twitter, meta)

description

string

With description Embedly will set the description response attribute to the open\_graph, meta, or twitter description if available in the page. Accepted values: (og, twitter, meta)

meta\_images

boolean

Will return only an image found in meta tags or an API response if set.

truefalse

a

boolean

Turns on/off player analytics

truefalse

dnt

boolean

Turns on/off Do Not Track support within embed
