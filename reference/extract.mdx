#### URL Expired

The URL for this request expired after 30 days.

## Response Attributes

**`original_url`**  
The url that was passed into Embedly. This will be something like a bit.ly shortened link or if there is no redirect it will be the same as the `url` attribute.

**`url`**  
The effective url of the request. Whatever Embedly found at the end of any  
redirects.

**`type`**  
Returns the type of the document at this URL, they can be one of the following:

*   `html`: The most common response. The resource is an `html` document.
*   `text`: The response is a plain `text` document.
*   `image`: This is a static viewable `image`.
*   `video`: This is a playable `video`.
*   `audio`: This is a playable `audio`.
*   `rss`: The resource is an `rss` feed.
*   `xml`: The resource is an `xml` document.
*   `atom`: The resource is an `atom` feed.
*   `json`: The resource is a `json` document.
*   `ppt`: The resource is a PowerPoint document.
*   `link`: This is a general embed that may not contain HTML.
*   `error`: When accessing multiple urls at once Embedly will not throw HTTP errors as normal. Instead, it will return an `error` type response that includes the `url`, `error_message` and `error_code`.

**`cache_age`**  
How long Embedly is going to cache the response for? Generally, this is for a day, unless some external factor tells us to reevaluate the resource.

**`safe`**  
Safe is an attribute that tells you if the url is on a phishing or malware list. Embedly uses Google's  
[Safe Browsing API](http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/)
 to obtain a list of malicious urls. By using this API through our service, you agree to its[terms of service](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/terms)
.

**`provider_name`**  
The name of the resource provider.

**`provider_url`**  
The url of the resource provider.

**`provider_display`**  
For display purposes we `include provider_display`, it's the subdomain, hostname, and public suffix of the provider.

**`favicon_url`**  
The url of the favicon.

**`favicon_colors`**  
List of dominant colors extracted from `favicon_url`.

**`title`**  
The title of the resource. It's picked in the following order:

*   The rss entry's title
*   The oEmbed title
*   The open graph title
*   The `meta` title tag
*   The `title` attribute in the `head` element

**`authors`**  
A list of all the authors that are associated with this article. Each author has a `url` and `name`. Here is an example response:

```
    [{\
      "name": "Sean Creeley"\
      "url": "http://blog.embed.ly/screeley"\
    }]

```

Most articles have only one author, but `authors` makes it flexible enough to add more if necessary.

**`published`**  
A representation of the date which the article was published in milliseconds. If an `offset` is present, then there was timezone data present, otherwise we assume the Date is in UTC. Like all dates, this is a little confusing, so we will explain. Say the Embedly parser came across the following HTML:

```
<span class="pubdate">Aug 24, 2012</span>

```

Because there is no timezone information, Embedly will not return an `offset` and the `published` attribute will be in UTC. We will return the following response:

```
"published": 1345766400000

```

**`offset`**  
The UTC offset of the date in milliseconds. See the above section for more information about `offset` and how to use it with the `published` time.

**`description`**  
The description of the resource. It's picked in the following order:

*   The oEmbed description
*   The open graph description
*   The `meta` description tag
*   An excerpt pulled programmaticly by Embedly

**`lead`**  
Often there is a lead paragraph that is a brief summary of the rest of the  
article. Embedly tries to pull this lead paragraph out for a better reading  
experience. It is always a `p` tag, i.e.::

```
"lead": "<p>This is a summary of the below article</p>"

```

**`content`**  
This is the html that we pulled from the URL. It's been sanitized, so it will only contain the following tags::

```
'a', 'abbr', 'acronym', 'b', 'big', 'blockquote', 'br', 'cite', 'code',
'del', 'dfn', 'em', 'i', 'ins', 'kbd', 'mark', 'pre', 'q', 's', 'samp',
'small', 'span', 'strike', 'strong', 'sub', 'sup', 'time', 'tt', 'u',
'var', 'p', 'div', 'a', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'img', 'ol', 'ul',
'li'

```

All tag attributes have been removed as well. The only effective attributes are:

*   `href` on an `a` tag
*   `src` on an `img` tag

**`keywords`**

Returns the meta keywords from the page.

The `keywords` object gives you a list of ranked keywords extracted from the article or blog text of a URL. This is different from the meta keywords defined by the page. Embedly uses its own ranking system to determine which keywords are the most relevant. Each keyword has two values:

```
``name``
    Name of the keyword.

``score`` (DEPRECATED)
    Returns 0 for no specific relevance.
    Score of the keyword from the article, larger numbers infer more relevance.

```

**`language`**

Returns the language code for the page. Typically ISO639-1 standard, i.e. en, fr, etc.

**`entities`** (DEPRECATED)

Returns an empty list.

The `entities` object gives you a list of proper nouns (persons, places, and things) extracted from the article or blog text of a URL. Along with each entity name, Embedly counts the number of times it appears in the text. Each entity has two values:

```
``name``
    Name of the entity (person, place, or thing).

``count``
    Number of times an entity appears in the text.

```

**`images`**  
The `images` object is a list of, at most, 5 images that Embedly found while processing the URL. Along with the list of images we pull various pieces of information about each image including dimensions, dominant colors, entropy, captions, and size. Each image contains:

```
``width``: The width of the image in pixels (required)
``height``: The height of the image in pixels (required)
``size``: The size in bytes of the image.
``caption``: An image  caption is the short description or sentence that many sites provide below each image. This text usually describes what the image is depicting.
``entropy``: Image entropy can be roughly thought of as how "busy" an image is. Image entropy can be useful in programmatically choosing the type of image to display. For instance, if an API user wants to display photographic type images, but not logos, they can ignore images with lower entropy.
``colors``: The dominant colors of an image are those colors that make up the majority of
an image. The ``color`` attribute is the RGB representation of the color and and the ``wight`` is how prevalent that color is in the image.

```

**`app_links`**  
There are few different specs for deep linking, they include [App Links](http://applinks.org/)
, Twitter's [App Card](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/app)
 and Google's [App Indexing](http://developer.android.com/training/app-indexing/enabling-app-indexing.html)
. Embedly parses and returns all three in a list of objects. Each is dependent on the spec, but two attributes are the same for each:

```
``namespace``: The type of the deep link. ``ai``, ``twitter`` or ``google 
``type``: The type of the device the deep link targets ``ipad``, ``iphone``, ``andriod``, ``ios`` etc.

```

**`media`**  
The media is primary type of content (video, photo, etc.) that is associated with a `url`. It follows the general pattern of the [/1/oembed](/docs/oembed)
 Response, but with only a limited set of attributes. Note: It is optional and only available if we can classify it as such type.

**`type`**  
The resource type. Valid values, along with value-specific parameters, are described below.

### The photo type

This type is used for representing static photos. The following parameters are  
defined:

`url`  
The source URL of the image. Consumers should be able to insert this URL  
into an`<img>`element. Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are valid.

`width`  
The width in pixels of the image specified in the `url` parameter.

`height`  
The height in pixels of the image specified in the `url` parameter.

### The video type

This type is used for representing playable videos. The following parameters  
are defined:

`html`  
The HTML required to embed a video player. The HTML should have no padding  
or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to  
avoid XSS vulnerabilities.

`width`  
The width in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied  
the HTML returned will expand horizontally to the size of its parent  
container.

`height`  
The height in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied  
the HTML returned will expand vertically to the size of its parent  
container.

### The rich type

This type is used for rich HTML content that does not fall under one of the  
other categories. The following parameters are defined:

`html` (required)  
The HTML required to display the resource. The HTML should have no padding  
or margins. Consumers may wish to load the HTML in an off-domain iframe to  
avoid XSS vulnerabilities. The markup should be valid XHTML 1.0 Basic.

`width`  
The width in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied  
the HTML returned will expand horizontally to the size of its parent  
container.

`height`  
The height in pixels required to display the HTML. If not supplied the HTML returned will expand vertically to the size of its parent container.

### Optional media fields

**`age_restriction`**  
A string value for age restrictions; valid values include variations of 18+, 13+, R, PG. Only present if populated.

url

string

The URL is to retrieve embedding information. This URL must be escaped to ensure that Embedly retrieves the correct link. For example, this Embedly URL.

urls

string

A comma separated list of urls for Embedly to process. Each URL must be escaped, but commas separating URLS must NOT be URL encoded. urls accepts a maximum of 10 urls at a time. Embedly processes these urls in parallel, therefore, it’s quicker to use urls for batched processing.

maxwidth

int32

This is the maximum width of the embed in pixels. maxwidth is used for scaling down embeds so they fit into a certain width. If the container for an embed is 500px you should pass maxwidth=500 in the query parameters.

maxheight

int32

This is the maximum height of the embed in pixels. Functions the same as maxwidth, but for the height of the embed instead. It’s noteworthy that maxwidth is preferred over maxheight.

width

int32

Will scale embeds type rich and video to the exact width that a developer specifies in pixels. Embeds smaller than this width will be scaled up and embeds larger than this width will be scaled down. Note that using this may cause distortion when scaling up embeds.

height

int32

Will scale embeds type rich and video to the exact height that a developer specifies in pixels. Embeds smaller than this height will be scaled up and embeds larger than this height will be scaled down. Note that using this may cause distortion when scaling up embeds.

format

string

The response format – Accepted values: (xml, json)

wmode

string

Will append the wmode value to the flash object. Possible values include window, opaque and transparent.

callback

string

Returns a (jsonp) response format. The callback is the name of the javascript function to execute.

allowscripts

boolean

By default Embedly does not return script embeds for jsonp requests. They just don’t work and cause lots of issues. In some cases, you may need the script tag for saving and displaying later. In order for Embedly to send the script embeds over jsonp add allowscripts=true. Use with care, and this option is only valid when a callback is supplied, otherwise, it is ignored.

truefalse

autoplay

boolean

This will tell the video/rich media to automatically play when the media is loaded. Accepted values: (true, false) Default: false

truefalse

words

string

The words parameter works by trying to split the description at the closest sentence to that word count

chars

string

chars is much simpler than words. Embedly will blindly truncate a description to the number of characters you specify adding ... at the end when needed.

luxe

boolean

With luxe Embedly’s iframe is initially loaded with poster image and play button rather than loading the whole embed. When the user clicks play the embed is loaded and starts playing.

truefalse

secure

boolean

secure allows you to serve embeds with a SSL connection. You can also serve images over SSL with our Display product. You can enable this by adding secure=true.

truefalse

scheme

string

scheme allows to set the protocol scheme explicity to http or https. By default embeds are sent back protocol-less so that they will work in any page. You can explicity set a protocol by adding scheme=https.

title

string

With title Embedly will set the title response attribute to the open\_graph, meta, or twitter title if available in the page. Accepted values: (og, twitter, meta)

description

string

With description Embedly will set the description response attribute to the open\_graph, meta, or twitter description if available in the page. Accepted values: (og, twitter, meta)

meta\_images

boolean

Will return only images found in meta tags or an API response if set.

truefalse

a

boolean

Turns on/off player analytics

truefalse

dnt

boolean

Turns on/off Do Not Track support within embed
